Adding music to your server couldn't be easier!

1. Create new folder for musics to be added your trackmania server c:\tm_music\
2. Place music what you want to hear at server (.ogg files) to the folder
3. unzip the MusicBoxManager.zip
4. Run MusicBoxManager 
5. select [File] --> [Import] 
6. select your music folder (c:\tm_music)
7. select [File] --> [Save]
8. Upload your music folder to web provider (ftp, sftp, scp, whatever)

9. test that the music files and index.csv are accessible by visiting your uploaded music folder..
   (or see example of the files at http://reaby.kapsi.fi/ml/musictest)

10. edit manialive config.ini 
11. add following lines:

manialive.plugins[] = 'eXpansion\MusicBox';
ManiaLivePlugins\eXpansion\MusicBox\Config.url = 'http://reaby.kapsi.fi/ml/musictest';

^^ replace the address with your music url folder,
but you can use this to test that the plugin works.

12. restart manialive

incase you don't have windows or dont' want to run musicmanager you can create the music index
file manually, see example at http://reaby.kapsi.fi/ml/musictest/index.csv

You can edit easily the file with excel or openoffice calc
