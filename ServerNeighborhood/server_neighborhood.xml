    Refresh the Panel every [INT] seconds.
    Recommendation:
    5-10 sec. on low visited servers (cpu intensive, lag in game)
    10-30 sec. on high volume servers (less cpu intensive, less lag in game)

    <!--
    If you wish to save the Server-Information to a remote destination e.g. on a FTP-Server
    just use the following format "ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/serverneighbors/"
    NOTE: Make sure your php option "allow_url_fopen" is set to "on" and the given path exist!

    If you wish to save the Server-Information local, then make sure that the path to the files
    are read- and writeable by the user that runs xaseco (see "man chmod" under UN!X/Linux)!

    Some examples for <storing_path>:
     - Linux (local):		<storing_path>/home/user/serverneighbors/</storing_path>
     - Windows (local):		<storing_path>C:/Trackmania/serverneighbors/</storing_path>
     - FTP (remote):		<storing_path>ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/serverneighbors/</storing_path>
    //-->
    <storing_path></storing_path>

    <!--
    The server neighbors, max. 56 servers!
    <path> = path to the "<login of dedicated server neighbor>_serverinfo.xml" including the filename, with the same conditions as <storing_path> (but only for read access)

    Some examples for <path> (assuming "clanserver007" as <login>):
     - Linux (local):		<path>/home/user/serverneighbors/clanserver007_serverinfo.xml</path>
     - Windows (local):		<path>C:/Trackmania/serverneighbors/clanserver007_serverinfo.xml</path>
     - FTP (remote):		<path>ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/serverneighbors/clanserver007_serverinfo.xml</path>
