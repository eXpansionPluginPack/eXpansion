#eXpansion User Interface
	The idea for the user interface is to provide clean, powerful but still easy of use Interface that you just use with ease. The learning curve should be quite low.

		All windows are movable and we have drop down boxes, input fields and other cool ui elements!
		Widgets positions can be changed and visibility can be toggled
		Basic server functions are accessible by mouse using the menu
		Full graphical administration of the server, no need to use commands, if you don't like to
		Familiar chat commands are though available, support for nearly 90% of Fast and XAseco commands

#Menu access
		1. Use mouse and do right click anywhere at screen
		2. A menu will appear next to mouse pointer
		Type "/help" and press enter to see all available chat commands
